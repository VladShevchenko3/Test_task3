# Project Description
This project aims to build a model that predicts a target variable based on a set of 53 anonymized features. The dataset used in this project is provided in the `internship_train.csv` file. The performance of the model will be evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric. The final model will be used to make predictions on a test set provided in the internship_`hidden_test.csv` file.

# Requirements
To run the code in this project, you will need the following packages:

* joblib==1.2.0
* numpy==1.24.2
* pandas==1.5.3
* scikit-learn==1.1.1
You can install all packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

Installation
To reproduce the results of this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Navigate to the repository: cd your-repo
Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook
Open the analysis.ipynb notebook and follow the instructions.
Usage
To train the model and make predictions on new data, follow the steps in the analysis.ipynb notebook. The notebook contains detailed instructions on how to load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate its performance. Once the final model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data by running the predict.py script. The predictions will be saved in a file named predictions.csv.

Results
The final model achieved an RMSE of X on the test set. The analysis of the dataset revealed that feature A and B were the most important predictors of the target variable. We also found that there were some missing values and outliers in the data, which we handled using imputation and normalization techniques. Overall, the model performed well on the test set and can be used to make predictions on new data.

Future Work
There are several ways in which this project can be extended or improved. One possible direction is to explore different models and compare their performance. Another direction is to perform more feature engineering and selection to improve the predictive power of the model. Additionally, we could try to gather more data or use external sources of information to enrich the dataset and improve the model's accuracy.
